     *     in IndexedDB specific to this instance. An error will be thrown if
     *     a duplicate name is detected.
     * @param {Object} [options]
     * @param {Function} [options.onSync] A function that gets invoked whenever
     *     the 'sync' event fires. The function is invoked with an object
     *     containing the `queue` property (referencing this instance), and you
     *     can use the callback to customize the replay behavior of the queue.
     *     When not set the `replayRequests()` method is called.
     *     Note: if the replay fails after a sync event, make sure you throw an
     *     error, so the browser knows to retry the sync event later.
     * @param {number} [options.maxRetentionTime=7 days] The amount of time (in
     *     minutes) a request may be retried. After this amount of time has
     *     passed, the request will be deleted from the queue.
     * @param {boolean} [options.forceSyncFallback=false] If `true`, instead
     *     of attempting to use background sync events, always attempt to replay
     *     queued request at service worker startup. Most folks will not need
     *     this, unless you explicitly target a runtime like Electron that
     *     exposes the interfaces for background sync, but does not have a working
     *     implementation.
