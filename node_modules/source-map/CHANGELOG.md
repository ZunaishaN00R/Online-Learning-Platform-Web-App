# Change Log

## 0.7.3

* Fix a bug where nested uses of `SourceMapConsumer` could result in a
  `TypeError`. [#338](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/issues/338)
  [#330](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/issues/330)
  [#319](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/issues/319)

## 0.7.2

* Another 3x speed up in `SourceMapConsumer`. Read about it here:
  http://fitzgeraldnick.com/2018/02/26/speed-without-wizardry.html

## 0.7.1

* Updated TypeScript typings. [#321][]

[#321]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/pull/321

## 0.7.0

* `SourceMapConsumer` now uses WebAssembly, and is **much** faster! Read about
  it here:
  https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/oxidizing-source-maps-with-rust-and-webassembly/

* **Breaking change:** `new SourceMapConsumer` now returns a `Promise` object
  that resolves to the newly constructed `SourceMapConsumer` instance, rather
  than returning the new instance immediately.

* **Breaking change:** when you're done using a `SourceMapConsumer` instance,
  you must call `SourceMapConsumer.prototype.destroy` on it. After calling
  `destroy`, you must not use the instance again.

* **Breaking change:** `SourceMapConsumer` used to be able to handle lines,
  columns numbers and source and name indices up to `2^53 - 1` (aka
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`). It can now only handle them up to `2^32 - 1`.

* **Breaking change:** The `source-map` library now uses modern ECMAScript-isms:
  `let`, arrow functions, `async`, etc. Use Babel to compile it down to
  ECMAScript 5 if you need to support older JavaScript environments.

* **Breaking change:** Drop support for Node < 8. If you want to support older
versions of node, please use v0.6 or below.

## 0.5.6

* Fix for regression when people were using numbers as names in source maps. See
  #236.

## 0.5.5

* Fix "regression" of unsupported, implementation behavior that half the world
  happens to have come to depend on. See #235.

* Fix regression involving function hoisting in SpiderMonkey. See #233.

## 0.5.4

* Large performance improvements to source-map serialization. See #228 and #229.

## 0.5.3

* Do not include unnecessary distribution files. See
  commit ef7006f8d1647e0a83fdc60f04f5a7ca54886f86.

## 0.5.2

* Include browser distributions of the library in package.json's `files`. See
  issue #212.

## 0.5.1

* Fix latent bugs in IndexedSourceMapConsumer.prototype._parseMappings. See
  ff05274becc9e6e1295ed60f3ea090d31d843379.

## 0.5.0

* Node 0.8 is no longer supported.

* Use webpack instead of dryice for bundling.

* Big speedups serializing source maps. See pull request #203.

* Fix a bug with `SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor` and sources that
  explicitly start with the source root. See issue #199.

## 0.4.4

* Fix an issue where using a `SourceMapGenerator` after having created a
  `SourceMapConsumer` from it via `SourceMapConsumer.fromSourceMap` failed. See
  issue #191.

* Fix an issue with where `SourceMapGenerator` would mistakenly consider
  different mappings as duplicates of each other and avoid generating them. See
  issue #192.

## 0.4.3

* A very large number of performance improvements, particularly when parsing
  source maps. Collectively about 75% of time shaved off of the source map
  parsing benchmark!

* Fix a bug in `SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor` and fuzzy
  searching in the presence of a column option. See issue #177.

* Fix a bug with joining a source and its source root when the source is above
  the root. See issue #182.

* Add the `SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources` method to
  determine when all sources' contents are inlined into the source map. See
  issue #190.

## 0.4.2

* Add an `.npmignore` file so that the benchmarks aren't pulled down by
  dependent projects. Issue #169.

* Add an optional `column` argument to
  `SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor` and better handle lines
  with no mappings. Issues #172 and #173.

## 0.4.1

* Fix accidentally defining a global variable. #170.

## 0.4.0

* The default direction for fuzzy searching was changed back to its original
  direction. See #164.

* There is now a `bias` option you can supply to `SourceMapConsumer` to control
  the fuzzy searching direction. See #167.

* About an 8% speed up in parsing source maps. See #159.

* Added a benchmark for parsing and generating source maps.

## 0.3.0

* Change the default direction that searching for positions fuzzes when there is
  not an exact match. See #154.

* Support for environments using json2.js for JSON serialization. See #156.

## 0.2.0

* Support for consuming "indexed" source maps which do not have any remote
  sections. See pull request #127. This introduces a minor backwards
  incompatibility if you are monkey patching `SourceMapConsumer.prototype`
  methods.

## 0.1.43

* Performance improvements for `SourceMapGenerator` and `SourceNode`. See issue
  #148 for some discussion and issues #150, #151, and #152 for implementations.

## 0.1.42

* Fix an issue where `SourceNode`s from different versions of the source-map
  library couldn't be used in conjunction with each other. See issue #142.

## 0.1.41

* Fix a bug with getting the source content of relative sources with a "./"
  prefix. See issue #145 and [Bug 1090768](bugzil.la/1090768).

* Add the `SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans` method to compute the
  column span of each mapping.

* Add the `SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor` method to find
  all generated positions associated with a given original source and line.

## 0.1.40

* Performance improvements for parsing source maps in SourceMapConsumer.

## 0.1.39

* Fix a bug where setting a source's contents to null before any source content
  had been set before threw a TypeError. See issue #131.

## 0.1.38

* Fix a bug where finding relative paths from an empty path were creating
  absolute paths. See issue #129.

## 0.1.37

* Fix a bug where if the source root was an empty string, relative source paths
  would turn into absolute source paths
