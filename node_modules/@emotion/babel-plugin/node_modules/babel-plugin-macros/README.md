## The problem

Check out <a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/09/11/zero-config-with-babel-macros" rel="nofollow">this guest post</a> on the Babel.js blog for a complete write up on the problem, motivation, and solution.

Currently, each babel plugin in the babel ecosystem requires that you configure
it individually. This is fine for things like language features, but can be
frustrating overhead for libraries that allow for compile-time code
transformation as an optimization.

## This solution

babel-plugin-macros defines a standard interface for libraries that want to use
compile-time code transformation without requiring the user to add a babel
plugin to their build system (other than `babel-plugin-macros`, which is ideally
already in place).

<details>

<summary>Expand for more details on the motivation</summary>

For instance, many css-in-js libraries have a css tagged template string
function:

```js
const styles = css`
  .red {
    color: red;
  }
`
```

The function compiles your css into (for example) an object with generated class
names for each of the classes you defined in your css:

```js
console.log(styles) // { red: "1f-d34j8rn43y587t" }
```

This class name can be generated at runtime (in the browser), but this has some
disadvantages:

- There is cpu usage/time overhead; the client needs to run the code to generate
  these classes every time the page loads
- There is code bundle size overhead; the client needs to receive a CSS parser
  in order to generate these class names, and shipping this makes the amount of
  js the client needs to parse larger.

To help solve those issues, many css-in-js libraries write their own babel
plugin that generates the class names at compile-time instead of runtime:

```js
// Before running through babel:
const styles = css`
  .red {
    color: red;
  }
`
// After running through babel, with the library-specific plugin:
const styles = {red: '1f-d34j8rn43y587t'}
```

If the css-in-js library supported babel-plugin-macros instead, then they
wouldn't need their own babel plugin to compile these out; they could instead
rely on babel-plugin-macros to do it for them. So if a user already had
`babel-plugin-macros` installed and configured with babel, then they wouldn't
need to change their babel configuration to get the compile-time benefits of the
library. This would be most useful if the boilerplate they were using came with
`babel-plugin-macros` out of the box, which is true for
[`create-react-app`][cra].

Although css-in-js is the most common example, there are lots of other things
you could use `babel-plugin-macros` for, like:

- Compiling GraphQL fragments into objects so that the client doesn't need a
  GraphQL parser
- Eval-ing out code at compile time that will be baked into the runtime code,
  for instance to get a list of directories in the filesystem (see
  [preval][preval])

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-macros
```

### User docs

Are you trying to use `babel-plugin-macros`? Go to
[`other/docs/user.md`](other/docs/user.md).

### Author docs

Are you trying to make your own macros that works with `babel-plugin-macros`? Go to
[`other/docs/author.md`](other/docs/author.md).
(you should probably read the user docs too).

### Caveats

#### Babel cache problem

> **Note:** This issue is not present when used in Create React App.

Most of the time you'll probably be using this with the babel cache enabled in webpack to rebuild faster. If your macro function is **not pure** which gets different output with same code (e.g., IO side effects) it will cause recompile mechanism fail. Unfortunately you'll also experience this problem while developing your macro as well. If there's not a change to the source code that's being transpiled, then babel will use the cache rather than running your macro again.

For now, to force recompile the code you can simply add a cache busting comment in the file:

```diff
import macro from 'non-pure.macro';

-// Do some changes of your code or
+// add a cache busting comment to force recompile.
macro('parameters');
```

This problem is still being worked on and is not unique to `babel-plugin-macros`. For more details and workarounds, please check related issues below:
