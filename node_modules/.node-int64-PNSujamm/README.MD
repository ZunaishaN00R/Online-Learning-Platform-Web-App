JavaScript Numbers are represented as [IEEE 754 double-precision floats](http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html).  Unfortunately, this means they lose integer precision for values beyond +/- 2^^53.  For projects that need to accurately handle 64-bit ints, such as [node-thrift](https://github.com/wadey/node-thrift), a performant, Number-like class is needed.  Int64 is that class.

Int64 instances look and feel much like JS-native Numbers.  By way of example ...
```js
// First, let's illustrate the problem ...
> (0x123456789).toString(16)
'123456789' // <- what we expect.
> (0x123456789abcdef0).toString(16)
'123456789abcdf00' // <-
